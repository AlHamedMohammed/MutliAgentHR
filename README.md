# AgentHR Multi-Agent System

Welcome to the **AgentHR Multi-Agent System Repository**.  
This project contains autonomous, intelligent HR agents designed to **streamline HR operations**, optimize recruitment, onboarding, performance management, compliance, and analytics.

Each agent is **autonomous**, operates at a **senior expert level**, and works in coordination with other agents to support HR teams and executives.
